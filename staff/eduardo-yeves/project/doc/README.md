# Vegazetas

## Intro

## Intro

**Vegazetas** is a web application that allows you to **create, view, edit, and delete recipes**. It features a **colorful**, **eye-catching**, and **simple** interface, offering a **comfortable** and **intuitive** user experienceâ€”both for creating recipes and for viewing them while cooking in the kitchen.

The app includes several **sections** and **features**. In terms of access, there is a section for **sign-up** and **login**. Once logged in, users will find a **navigation menu** to move between the different sections and a button to **create a recipe**.

It includes the **My Recipes** section, a list of recipe thumbnails created by the user with direct navigation to the **recipe view** when selected. Inside a recipe, users can delete it or navigate to the **edit recipe** section.

In the **edit** section, users can modify any recipe field, as well as remove or add new **images**, **tags**, **ingredients**, and **steps**. The recipe fields will be described in more detail in the [**Data Model**](#data-model) section.

In **future versions**, new features will be implemented, such as:

- Filtering recipes by *ingredients*, *tags*, and *titles*
- Viewing recipes from other users and a **like** button to save them in a new **My Favorites** section
- Sharing recipes via *link*
- A section for *recipe lists*
- External *links to recipes* outside of Vegazetas
- Creating recipes in *draft/private* mode to publish them later
- Modifying the *user profile* and deleting the account
- Automatically generating an *editable shopping list* based on recipe ingredients
- *Menu planning calendar*
- *Cooking mode*: a button to prevent the mobile or tablet screen from turning off while cooking
- Changing the *font size* in recipe view
- *Responsive app design*
- *And much more!*
